## C4 Diagrams

A simple overview of the structure of this project is maintained using C4 diagrams. These can be edited [here](https://lucid.app/lucidspark/5b53254d-274b-4512-9285-31eaf3057069/edit?viewport_loc=-3479%2C-2061%2C10362%2C5564%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_5ccb3d50-1ce8-411e-8ccb-4afb2b46af19)

## Code Diagrams

Some auto generated UML diagrams are occaisonally created using PyReverse and GraphViz... but these don't appear to add a lot of value so may not be kept up to date.
